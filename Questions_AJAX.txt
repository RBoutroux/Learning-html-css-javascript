How can you get any element in the HTML page to change one of its properties?
You can use javascript functions to change protperties in the HTML page. 

What is the principle of an AJAX call?
A browser can send requests to a web server. In that case, a web server’s response is an HTML file.
Such an exchange leads to a page reloading, that scrolls the page to the top.
Often, what we need is an exchange with the web server to update data. This doesn’t work with a
standart HTTP exchange.
Javascript is designed to interact with the page components. What we need is the javascript ability
to directly exchange with the web server. This is the AJAX purpose.
An AJAX call doesn't reload the page. You ask for data from the server and when you receive it you modify the HTML accordingly. 
We have to take into account some constraints :
• Server is listening for an HTTP request.
• HTTP requests are either GET or POST requests.
• For security reasons, Javascript cannot send a request to any server. It can only call a script on
the same server as the page it is executed in
• Javascript does not need an HTML response, only data to modify the current page.
That means Javascript/AJAX requests have to respect the HTTP protocol. To manage the exchange,
AJAX uses an xmlHttpRequest object.
As AJAX does not need an HTML response, but data to modify the current page. That means the web
server response might not be an HTML page but a data set. Response can be send using 3 formats :
text, XML and JSON
Here is the sequence of an AJAX call :
• a Javascript function is called. It requires data from the web server to complete.
• the Javascript function collect data in the page and prepares an AJAX call.
• the Javascript function sends a request to the server through the AJAX call. The request refers
to a script that might be executed on the web server.
• the server execute the requested script with data sent through the AJAX call. It is the same
process as a standart HTTP call.
• The script on the server produces a response as a set of data to send back to the javascript
function.
• web server send produced data back to the javascript function
• the Javascript function gets the response and extracts requested data
• the Javascript function uses data to alter the current page.

Can I call any script on any server with AJAX? What are AJAX restrictions?
• Server is listening for an HTTP request.
• HTTP requests are either GET or POST requests.
• For security reasons, Javascript cannot send a request to any server. It can only call a script on
the same server as the page it is executed in
• Javascript does not need an HTML response, only data to modify the current page
Javascript can only call a script on the same server as the page it is executed in. 
You also need to wait for the response, either using synchronous or asynchronous behaviour.
